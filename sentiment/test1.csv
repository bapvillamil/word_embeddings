5.70E+17,@USAirways I've been on hold for 90 minutes. This is terrible customer service. You messed up my reservation! http://t.co/oyLgeao7Y8
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
5.70E+17,"@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a ""no show"""
5.69E+17,"@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min...."
5.70E+17,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
5.68E+17,"@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.

Site won't work on Chrome, on several computers."
5.68E+17,"@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion"
5.69E+17,@united I was able to get a seat on earlier flight sfo to ind.  Can you add me to 6pm ord to IND?
5.69E+17,@SouthwestAir I actually could use a slight tweak to my return - not leaving here now til Monday -any way I can skip calling for that?
5.70E+17,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
5.68E+17,@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
5.69E+17,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
5.70E+17,@USAirways my in-laws flight Cancelled Flighted 4 tonight. U auto rebooked 4 flight on Tuesday that doesn't work. Can you help reFlight Booking Problems them?
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir and btwn gate a8 &amp; a15 I lost a diamond earring #dayjustgotWORSE! Pls have maintenance look for it!! http://t.co/UieSR3GHHO
5.68E+17,@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
5.68E+17,@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
5.70E+17,"@AmericanAir just curious. Thanks for the response as always, good or bad. Better than your competition."
5.69E+17,@JetBlue we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG
5.69E+17,@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
5.69E+17,@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
5.70E+17,@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?
5.70E+17,@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir Nicest people ever flight to Chicago.Thanks David Deane &amp; Norma Sedholm for making me feel comfortable ✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️

5.70E+17,@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
5.68E+17,@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir Trying desperately to get my boyfriend booked on the same US Airways flight as myself for the same price. Can you help?
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
5.69E+17,@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
5.70E+17,"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
5.70E+17,@USAirways flight #3739 leaving CVG. Gate agent had no computer and counted passengers on paper. I feel safe.
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
5.70E+17,"@USAirways flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer..."
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir Can I use an SWU on an Finnair codeshare of an American operated flight (JFK-MAN)?  Thanks in advance for the help!

5.68E+17,@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
5.70E+17,@USAirways No one answers your reservation phone line. I need to book travel with a  companion certificate. How do I get through?!!!
5.69E+17,@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent

5.70E+17,@JetBlue Happy Anniversary!! It's hard to believe you're 15!! You're so young!
5.68E+17,@SouthwestAir can someone help me set up a callback today?

5.70E+17,@united I6EP18
5.69E+17,@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
5.68E+17,@JetBlue my daughter's college game in Denver.  Only one set of parents will be there 😢😢😢
5.70E+17,@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather✈️
5.70E+17,"@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning."

5.68E+17,@USAirways this is crazy. Haven't spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
5.68E+17,@SouthwestAir how come on mobile I can't proceed w/o entering a postcode at purchase. I'm from Ireland and I don't have a postcode just.
5.68E+17,@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
5.68E+17,@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
5.69E+17,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
5.68E+17,@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
5.69E+17,@SouthwestAir I am just wondering when are you going to open up fares for November?
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
5.69E+17,@united I was able to get a seat on earlier flight sfo to ind.  Can you add me to 6pm ord to IND?

5.70E+17,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
5.68E+17,@USAirways this is crazy. Haven't spoken to a human yet. There has to be a better way. http://t.co/mEOAlCIPdD
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
5.68E+17,@SouthwestAir how come on mobile I can't proceed w/o entering a postcode at purchase. I'm from Ireland and I don't have a postcode just.
5.68E+17,@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
5.68E+17,@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
5.69E+17,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
5.68E+17,@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
5.69E+17,@SouthwestAir I am just wondering when are you going to open up fares for November?
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
5.70E+17,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
5.69E+17,@united I was able to get a seat on earlier flight sfo to ind.  Can you add me to 6pm ord to IND?
5.69E+17,@SouthwestAir I actually could use a slight tweak to my return - not leaving here now til Monday -any way I can skip calling for that?
5.70E+17,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
5.68E+17,@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
5.69E+17,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."

5.68E+17,@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
5.70E+17,"@AmericanAir just curious. Thanks for the response as always, good or bad. Better than your competition."
5.69E+17,@JetBlue we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG
5.69E+17,@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
5.69E+17,@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
5.70E+17,@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?
